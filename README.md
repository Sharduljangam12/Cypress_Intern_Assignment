Cypress Intern Assignment

This repository contains my solution for the Cypress Automation Internship Assignment.

I have completed all the required test cases, including UI tests, API tests, and an end-to-end flow.

📁 Project Structure

-- How to Run the Project --

Install dependencies

1) npm install


2) Open Cypress Test Runner

In the Cypress window, go to the E2E Testing section and run the tests.

All tests are designed to be stable, repeatable, and independent.

10) Update User (PUT)

11) Delete User (DELETE)

12) End-to-End Flow

A full UI form submission followed by creating a user through an API call.

-- Notes --

The test scripts follow the standard Cypress folder structure.

No external libraries were used outside of Cypress.

All scenarios were tested multiple times to ensure consistent behaviour.

The repo contains only the necessary files (node_modules excluded).

-- About This Submission --

This project represents my understanding of Cypress automation and my ability to write clean, structured, and reliable test cases.
If there are any improvements or suggestions, I’m always open to learning more.
